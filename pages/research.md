#### <u>Homogeneous Floquet time crystal from weak ergodicity breaking</u>
Recent works on observation of discrete time-crystalline signatures throw up major puzzles on the necessity
of localization for stabilizing such out-of-equilibrium phases. Motivated by these studies, we delve into a
clean interacting Floquet system whose quasi-spectrum conforms to the ergodic Wigner-Dyson distribution,
yet with an unexpectedly robust, long-lived time-crystalline order in the absence of fine-tuning or any explicit
local constraint. We relate such behavior to a measure zero set of nonthermal Floquet eigenstates with long-
range spatial correlations, which coexist with otherwise thermal states at near-infinite temperature and develop
a high overlap with a family of translationally invariant, symmetry-broken initial conditions. This resembles
the notion of “dynamical scar states” that remain robustly localized throughout a thermalizing Floquet spectrum
with fractured structure. We dub such a long-lived discrete time crystal formed in partially nonergodic systems,
“scarred discrete time crystal” which is distinct by nature from those stabilized by either many-body localization
or prethermalization mechanism.
